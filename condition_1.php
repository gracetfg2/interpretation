                <feedback><h3>Feedback 1: </h3>The flyer did not mention the 7 am start time. It also did not mention how entrants could win $300. As is, the reader could reasonably that everyone who runs wins the money. With the dominant dark grey background and black silhouettes the flyer's design is not very visually appealing. Also, the $300 on the flyer is being blocked somewhat by one of the runner's hand, making it somewhat difficult to see.</feedback>
