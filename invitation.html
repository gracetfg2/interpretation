        <h3>Be Creative. No Design Experience Required. </h3>
        <p>We are researchers at the University of Illinois doing a research study about how crowd feedback and online
reflection activities affect the design process. In this study, you will create a design that
requires you to generate a flyer for a half marathon. All designs and data collected in this study are for research purposes only.</p>



         <p>

         <h3>Procedure and Deadlines</h3>
         <p>​The study has two phases. In the first phase, you will need to submit your
initial design for the marathon. In the second phase, you will revise your initial design and complete a survey. All the activities are conducted online.</p>

<p>
<ul style='font-size: 18px'> 
<li>Deadline for the first phase: <span style='color:red'> August 5th at 11:59 pm (Central Time) </span>. </li>
<li>Deadline for the second phase: Two days after you complete the first stage of the study. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Please check your schedule before signing up.</p>


         <h3>Compensation and prizes:  </h3>
         <p>​We will provide $30 for full participation. The top 5 (out of
60) designs will receive a bonus of $20 US dollars. All compensation will be distributed
via Paypal, so you will need to provide a Paypal address if you want to receive the
compensation.</p>

         <h3>Selection Criteria:  </h3>
         <p>

        (1)​ You must be at least 18 years of age.<br>
        (2) You must allow us to maintain a copy of your design and feedback for research
        purposes.</p>
