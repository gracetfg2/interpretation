If the point of the event is to support the music program at local schools, that should be highlighted more, it is a motivating factor.  So, if Smooth Digital is a well known and recognizable group, then it's a good clear desigh.  However, it needs to present the info (specifically that it is a fundraiser) more clearly.","The sax player should be clearly visible, not behind the text, so we can see all of him (and what instrument he's playing!)  Would be good to either make the sax player a bit smaller (so he's in the foreground not the background,) or better yet, place either the date or price lower on the poster, closer to the bottom of the page.  The triangle shape of text at top is good, but you need to work on the placement of the sax player, he needs to be seen.","The sax player should be played up a bit, as it's very dark, perhaps a shadow with a lighter shade.  The yellow is great it makes the important info pop out, but the way it is, the color of the sax player is too close to the background color.  you don't want a massive contrast, but a small change that would bring him out a bit.","The overall design and silhouette of the band is good, I like that you can see the different members of the band, and the green shaded background is fine, good contrast with the black.  All the info is there and readable.  You may want to highlight that it is a benefit concert for a good cause.  

However, I'm thinking that the font used for the info is a bit distracting, especially with the white shadow around ""Smooth Digital.""I think it would look a bit cleaner with a more basic font instead of a script/calligraphy.  The date, time and location, could be on separate lines and left-justified, which would give a bit of a break from the all in lines, all centered approach for the heading, it would make it a bit more interesting.  The info at the bottom, however, should be all centered, it looks a bit unfinished with it filling most of the horizontal space, yet left-justified.

You might want to reduce the graphic size just slightly to give you a bit more space to play with the text, or add a ""sticker"" highlighting the fact that it's a benefit concert.","328","1059","0","19",NULL,NULL,NULL,"400","107","4","explanation","It helped me see what to look for, and what is important.","2","female","36to45"

Lay out is clear and concise. There are too many major elements that are blocked in this image with the exception of the guitar player in the back. The text is separated nicely.

Weaknesses here is I would like to see some more spacing in the back with players.

Aesthetics is general good. It's easy to read the message in the poster and understand the point. The green is a bit overbearing in spots.

A downside is that they anonymize the members of the music group, which may not be desirable. The text could use a better design; somehow it seems jumbled together and not aesthetically pleasing to read. A different font would be good, and maybe forming the text block into a shape would help as well. The text on the bottom is legible but also very busy.

It doesn't matter if you're working with text, images, or elements in a graphic
without a thoughtful, well-composed layout, your work would basically fall apart.

The key to mastering layout and composition is to think like a designer. 
Luckily, it's easier than it sounds. 
There are five basic principles that can help you transform your work and sharpen your eye for design.
Keep them in mind during your next project, and look for ways to apply them.

Proximity is all about using visual space to show relationships in your content. 
In practice, it's pretty simple—all you have to do is make sure related items are grouped together

Alignment is something you deal with all the time, even if you don't realize it. 
Whenever you type an email or create a document, the text is aligned automatically.","Today’s article is about understanding what is aesthetic design and its importance for the perception of usability. 
Humans like pretty and shiny design; they desire it much more than functional one.

There is a whole branch of philosophy exploring aesthetics. 
Let’s scratch the surface of the Aesthetics field and learn how it relates to our design work.","Most non-designers know when a design is aesthetically pleasing, but have a hard time explaining why. 
Non-designers often approve the final design of an app, website, or feature. 
Costly issues can occur when the decision maker cannot articulate the root problem behind a poor design. 
This usually results in the decision maker asking for many failed revisions.

Good typography results from much more than picking the right font. 
Poorly set type will produce a bad design no matter how beautiful the typeface. 
Typographic hierarchy and line-length and height are the two most overlooked concepts in Typography.

The Layout of an app or website can make or break the experience. Layout guides viewers through a design and reinforces brand.
 A layout with jumbled elements communicates disorder and sloppiness, whereas a layout with a consistent grid structure, and appropriate use of whitespace communicates clarity and thoughtfulness.

Understanding typography and layout will help non-designers understand why they perceive certain design to be more appealing than others. ","410","718","0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,"220","21","1","explanation","

The Charity event should have been made more prominent in the poster, since charity activities usually attract people to participate in events.
Overall, the major pro of the poster are that it is clear and simple, that is if Smooth Digital are a well-known band. The major downside of the poster is that it does not give the charity event more prominence since people generally like activities associated with charity and not many people like Jazz. ","The poster has a excellent display layout. It is however important to make sure that the sax player in the background is not covered by the text information about the dates, and time, alternatively that information could be moved to the bottom just above the other text information. Overall, the design is great especially the triangular format of the text that gives a direction to the eye of the viewer of the poster. The only downside is the sax player silhouette maybe covered a bit by the text information about the event, you could consider minimizing the silhouette's size a bit so that he is not obscured by the text information.","The sax player silhouette can be made a bit more prominent by adding a bit of color to his lining like that on the ""Smooth Digital"" frame, just enough to make him stand out but not grab all the viewers attention. The color scheme used is great, but the contrast of the yellow color in the text and the ""Smooth Digital"" logo should be made more congruent. The only downside is that the sax player silhouette maybe blending too much with the background and therefore need to be brought to the fore a bit more with some color.","The overall design of the poster is good. The color scheme is great. The silhouette brings out the element of the jazz band really well. I feel the font of the text could be improved for the ease of reading. The Smooth Digital logo comes out very clearly. The organisation of the text is good since it does not impede on the silhouette of the jazz band. However, I feel a bit more could be done to attract more attention to the fact that the event is associated with charity, since many people like to be associated with events related to charity.","881","1710","0","19",NULL,NULL,NULL,"296","179","7","explanation","It gave me a feel of how I should give my feedback.","7","male","26to35"

The only indication that this is a music show is the sax player in the background, and it is currently not a prominent element of the flyer. The fact that it is a charity event is also not being used to the fullest extent. The text explaining the charity event should be one of the primary elements.
Strengths: If Smooth Digital is a well known band, then the flyer is clean and works well.
Weaknesses: Needs more emphasis on the fact that it is a jazz band and also that it is a charity event.","The information is displayed well and has good contrast with the background. In order to keep the sax player (and his saxophone) from being covered, you might lower the date and ticket price text or shrink the size of the sax player.
Strengths: The layout of the elements creates a nice visual triangle that helps with readability. It provides direction for the viewer. Keep that in mind when adding additional information.
Weaknesses: The sax player should not be covered by text.","Other than making sure the sax player isn't covered, you might add a small amount of color to make him more visible. You could add a similar blue shadow to the sax player as the Smooth Digital text to give him more emphasis.
Strengths: The color scheme works well. The yellow works for highlighting important information. The contrast in Smooth Digital is also quite nice.
Weaknesses: The sax player is getting lost in the background. Small changes in color or treatment can give him more visibility without making him too prominent.","Concept: It's hard to tell what this band is actually about. Smooth Digital sounds like a modern or jazzy band but the typeface looks almost medieval. I like the silhouettes of the band members and it makes it easier to tell what sort of sound the band will have.
Strengths: Interesting illustration that helps provide information about band.
Weaknesses: The illustration, typeface, and content all seem to be saying different things about this concert.

Layout: There's good separation of sections on this poster, top, middle, and bottom. It might be good to think more about what the important information is on this flyer and have some more hierarchy in terms of the way the information is presented.
Strengths: Good separation of blocks of information.
Weaknesses: A lot of the info is put at the same level and is difficult to read.

Aesthetics: The illustration looks nice. The text is not very readable though, might rethink the typeface used. Also, the black on green at the top is a little difficult to read. You might want to make that green gradient more pronounced so there is more contrast between background and text.

Strengths: Provides a lot of relevant detail about the event.

Layout: The layout is visually split into thirds, which looks amateur. It would look better with text overlapping the silhouette. The eye isn't drawn to one single element. A photo of the band itself would be better than the silhouette. 
Strengths: Visually, it makes you want to read everything. 
Weaknesses: Poor use of space. 

Aesthetics: The green background isn't a flattering color. Font is difficult to read. Using a white color and italics for the event information further makes the text hard to read.

Upon further inspection, this is for a charity, but it seems like a footnote, literally and figuratively, on this flyer. If you want people to attend the event for the charity, this should be the main aspect of the flyer - this is what will bring people out, they want to support! 

It is a very clean, uncluttered poster and the name of the band is right in your face. I'd like to see more info regarding the charity as the main draw to the poster, and also advertise that Smooth Digital is a jazz band.","The information that is posted on the flyer is very nicely laid out. The triangular formatting of the specifics is great - it draws the reader in and helps them follow along. I would reposition or change the size of the sax player. It's not totally clear what he's doing as he's partially hidden behind text - you don't want to obscure him and confuse the reader.","The colors are very dark and it could be hard to differentiate the background from the sax player. I would bring the color up a bit just so that he is more noticeable, but still be careful not to make him the main focus of the flyer since the information is what's really important. You could also just add a shadow behind him to bring him out a bit.

The colors are great, I especially like the usage of yellow for the information. Just be sure to make the sax player pop from the background just a bit, but be careful not to make him the focal point.","Overall Concept
I like the flow of the poster. It draws the attention of the reader but isn't harsh on the eyes. I know exactly who is performing but I don't know what kind of band they are - it appears to be jazz, but I would perhaps add a note about it. The flyer does a great job of highlighting a band performing but it looks like it's to support a charity - a quick glance and you wouldn't know that. I would try to make that the focal point of the flyer, perhaps that could be moved to the top of the flyer instead of as a footnote. The flyer is a little cluttered, I would maybe only keep pertinent information.
Layout
The layout is mostly good. The band name is prominent,where they are from is listed, and their time slot is listed immediately. Further information regarding the event is listed at the bottom. This is good, but I think it could be better if you made the image of the band smaller, kept it to the right side of the flyer, and maybe listed some of the information regarding the event in a column on the left, careful to not obscure the band. I would also move information about the charity to the top so that people are aware it's not just a band playing.
Aesthetics
I like the green background and the way it has an ombre look. The band stands out very well. I'm not a huge fan of the white border surrounding the name of the band name. I think I would perhaps use a different, thicker font, and use white as the color of that font. The font for the name of the school is also a little confusing too. Something more clean would be nice. Same goes for the font towards the bottom of the page. Again, think about the side column to unclutter the flyer.","393","1645","0","44",NULL,NULL,NULL,"916","126","7","explanation","If I hadn't done the practice, I don't think I would know exactly how to rate the flyer I was given.
