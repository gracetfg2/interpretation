"2","A132MSWBBVTOES","The overall design is easy to understand, and the details are clear. The silhouette is choppy, but the shadow is nice. Color highlights could enhance the image -- maybe design the silhouette or the font of the date in a red color.","There are too many fonts used -- reducing this number would enhance readability. I cannot tell which way the runner is facing, and the silhouette looks choppy, especially in contrast to the high quality cityscape header. Does this race occur at night? Since the image is a city at night, I am given the idea that this is a night race.","I enjoyed the header image and font, as well as the silhouette of the runner. The middle of the flyer could use some work (between ""NYC Central Park"" and the URL). This seems out of place, with too much line spacing, making the design read poorly. The font should be shorter and wider, which would give it a better contrast against the heading and date. The bottom of the flyer is okay, but I would like to see more color to make the foreground pop, as well as more spaced out letters so it could be read from a distance. Perhaps design the runner in grey and the ground in black, while increasing the font spacing.","I feel that the 13.1 is unnecessary, since it's already established that this is a half marathon. The image of the runner on the right should be redesigned in a smoother fashion. Choose one font and use it consistently throughout. I'd suggest a border on the header image of the cityscape, as to distinguish it from the background and the text body a little better. I like the muted, mostly black-and-white color scheme; I don't feel that there's a need for color.","398","569","0","8","3","4","5","185","24","5","explanation","I feel that there's not much feedback that I can give on the design that hasn't already been given, but I did my best to incorporate all of my thoughts into this. Therefore, I think it's useful, but not extremely useful or original.","5","male","26to35"
"3","AMZV70TID53WY","The design is simple to understand and the time and place are clear. The runner is alright but odd looking, but I like the shadow behind them. I dont like how there is no color it could use something like red or a bright color to contrast with the runner. Even the font, something more eye drawing and to make it pop more. ","More than two fonts is distracting. You cant tell what direction the runner is heading. The runner doesnt look well done compared to the image of the city above. Since the image is at night it makes it unclear if the race is at night. ","They like flyer image and up and the runner. They dont like the text in the middle. It looks clumsy and the line spacing is too much. The letters could be different to contrast better with the rest of the flyer. More color to contrast with the background would be better and spaced more so its readable from a distance. Make the ground black to make the date more readable.","I would make the runner a higher quality image. I would change the image to a daytime picture. I would change a color to make the flyer pop more rather than all dull colors. Change the words in the middle so the spacing is less awkward.

"4","A3K5DCHBNL0GRY","Overall design is good, with all relevant information presented in a concise and clear manner. While the silhouette of the runner is a good addition, the angular style of the runner doesn't come off as aesthetically pleasing. However, the shaded part behind the runner is nice. Another area where the poster could be improved would be the use of color. The current draft lacks punch to draw in visual interest. Perhaps a splash of red incorporated into the poster, for example in the silhouette or the date, would give the poster more visual impact.","There are multiple fonts being used in the poster and the visual dissonance it creates is distracting. Reducing the number of fonts would help. Of minor note is the ambiguity of the runner's silhouette; it's not clear whether the runner is running towards the viewer or away. Having a bit more detail would probably make it less confusing. Also the silhouette's angular design makes it look rough and unrefined, especially next to the detail image of the skyline behind it. Once again, having a more detailed runner image would address this. Finally, the poster gives the impression that the even is to be held at night due to the dark shape of the runner and the image of the skyline being a nighttime one. Using brighter, daytime images would help reduce any potential confusion as to the time of day the event will be held.","The upper portion of the poster and the runner's silhouette are both very good. The text in the middle portion, beginning with ""NYC Central Park"" all the way to the event URL isn't quite as good. That portion looks like it was sloppily put together with poor spacing, making it hard to read. The font itself doesn't seem like it fits with the much bolder, weightier typeface of the rest of the poster. It needs to be adjusted to fit in better. The lower portion is okay, but could be improved if there was were contrast or spacing to separate the white text from the gray background. As it is now, it's a bit hard to read from a distance. Perhaps the runner can be made gray and the ground black?","I would use a more detailed image for the runner's silhouette and use more uniform typeface throughout the poster.","1524","1645","0","6","6","6","5","122","64","6","explanation","I think it let me understand multiple points of view and let me really contemplate what changes really mattered and needed to be addressed.","5","male","26to35"
"5","A94DL4GI8ZBUO","The overall design of the ad is great and the text, including the time and date are clear.  The runner graphic is a little rough on the eyes, but the shadow graphic is nice.  Overall, the ad has a lack of color.  It could definitely use some contrasting colors to make the ad more visually appealing.  One example is having the runner graphic a different color, such as red, or perhaps the font of the date, etc.  The ad needs more color to have the eye be drawn to it.","The use of two fonts in the graphic is distracting on the eyes.  Also it's hard to tell which way the runner is heading and it's overall appearance looks choppy and incomplete compared to the high quality city background on top.  The city background is at night so it's confusing to the reader what time of day the race will occur.","The overall top part of the ad and the runner figure look great.  The text to left of the runner looks odd and has too much line-spacing, making the ad hard to read.  The overall font size should be smaller for that section to provide better contrast against the heading and date.  The bottom looks good but it could use more color contrast and better letter-spacing, making it easier to be read from a distance.  Having the runner a lighter color with the ground for the background of ""October 1 2016"" darker would provide better contrast.  The least thing that should be done is to increase letter spacing.","The ad needs better use of color.  It's odd to have just the city image in color and everything else in a shade of black.  To make an ad visually appealing, different colors must be used, reds, blues, greens, etc.  The middle section's text needs to be slightly smaller because it is visually at odds with the title of the race and the date below.  Other than that, everything else looks okay.","527","734","0","11","6","5","7","208","48","6","explanation","It helped gathered all the weak points of the ad together and helped me to come up with my own set of feedback based on the compilation of prior feedback I saw.","4","male","26to35"
"6","A36MOV8E6SYHCR","I agree with the mention of the runner looking a little choppy, and the lack of color. I would also add that the ""13.1"" should be a completely different font set. Make it to where things kind of coexist more evenly then just different font formats all over the place. Also the placement of ""13.1"" cuts into the bottom shape. so a little realignment as well should make things more unified.","I would agree about the motion of the runner, and opt for a royality-free kind of image that's not just a vague silhouette. Or if a person is in direct contact with those sponsoring the race, include more graphic details as well.","The clutter i agree with, font selection should be noted as well. I'd opt for centering the main points of the race that way it stands out from afar instead of having to adjust your eyes in so many directions that it makes the viewer just give up.","The ""Run @ NYC"" is perfect. However the parts from ""NYC Central Park"" down to the registration url needs a different font set. Also ""13.1"" is bleeding into the gray bottom outline as well. And i would remove the clip-art, use a royality free (or get the rights to a previous years' runner) instead. ","473","672","0","10","7","7","7","203","60","7","explanation","There's a lot of little adjustments to be made, but the message itself is easy to comprehend, but if you want a would be runner to get the information in a quicker fashion, even the slightest adjustment to the text style and positioning can be the difference in only 3 runners sighing up, to 1000's.
